# Portfolio.Backend
This repository contains the backend for [my portfolio site](https://jonathanbout.com).

It currently supports:
- Proxying requests to skillicons.dev for caching
- Accessing GitHub stats, retrieved with the GraphQL API
- Accessing Gravatar icons of users

It also has some endpoints for JWT authentication and managing the cache.
